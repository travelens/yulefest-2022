We booked both the [Homestead](https://www.dryridge.com.au/pages/homestead) and the [Sunrise Lodge](https://www.dryridge.com.au/pages/sunriselodge).

The Homestead is set on top of a ridge overlooking the vineyard. The Estate enjoys spectacular views of the Blue Mountains sandstone escarpment that is transformed into bright orange and pink colours at sunset.

There is a large living room area with open fireplace, designer couch with big country dining room table. The residence also has a beautiful fully equipped gourmet kitchen with stainless steel gas cook top. The kitchen opens to a big balcony that directly overlooks the vineyard.

The Sunrise Lodge is nNestled on the edge of our boutique vineyard with magnificent escarpment views across the Megalong Valley. Purpose designed, the lodge comprises two large bedrooms each with an en-suite bathroom, spacious central living area with open fire and a fully-equipped kitchen and large deck.
