Ivan and Dagmar prepared a delicious Italian dinner of smoked trout, a cheese and meat platter, followed by duck ragu and saffron and truffle risotto. We all dressed in Christmas outfits. I wore my Christmas coloured cheongsam.

After dinner, we had drinks and exchanged Kris Kringles. All in all it was a fun night and a great end to this short trip.
