[Megalong Creek Estate Vineyard](https://www.megalongcreekestate.com/) was established in 2002. This family farm run boutique vineyard is situated in the beautiful Megalong Valley, Blue Mountains. The grapes are grown here and then hand picked and transported to Mudgee for wine making. The Wine maker is the award winning and highly regarded third generation wine maker - Jacob Stein of Robert Steins wines. The wines are 'Single Vineyard' and include Viognier, Pinot Grigio, Pinot and Shiraz. They planted Pinot, Grenache and Mourvedre in 2018. Their range of wines from the varieties grown on the property also include a Sparkling which we have named 'Prozzante', this is a lightly sparked Prosecco style wine. They also have a Late Harvest unique Dessert style wine.

The current temporary cellar door is a unique, re-purposed shipping container and barn with a purpose built tasting bar and beautiful views of the Majestic Megalong. It has beautiful valley views, alpacas grazing in the foreground and a towering sandstone escarpment backdrop! In early 2023 they hope to commence building a new cellar door.
