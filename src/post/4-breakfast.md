Established in 1956, the Megalong Valley Tea Rooms have proudly served up scones and apple pie to generations of Blue Mountains residents and guests.

They also offer all-day breakfast and lunch with seasonal specials. We stopped by here on the way back to have a late breakfast, before we drove back to Sydney.
