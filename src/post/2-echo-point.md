We woke up the next morning and took a walk from our Airbnb to Echo Point, where we were greeted with the spectacular Jamison Valley covered in a blanket of mist.

Echo Point lookout is located on the boundary of Blue Mountains National Park.

Part of the Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage Property, the Three Sisters is an iconic formation and there are different versions of the Aboriginal story of the Three Sisters.

Standing proudly in the land of the Gundungurra and Darug People, the traditional custodians of this declared Aboriginal Place, the imposing Three Sisters is best seen from Echo Point lookout, just outside the national park, on the edge of the plateau above. These three weathered sandstone peaks, formed thousands of years ago through erosion, are set among the cliffs of the Jamison Valley. From the lookout, we can also see the Ruined Castle and Mount Solitary.
