Nestled in the beautiful Megalong Valley, surrounded by towering sandstone escarpments, [Dryridge Estate](https://www.dryridge.com.au/) is a stunning boutique vineyard 20 minutes by car from Blackheath, the nearest Blue Mountains township.

We enjoyed delicious wines, cheese platters and some of the best scenery in the Blue Mountains. The selection included cheeses, cold meats, delicious accompaniments like pickles, olives and sundried tomatoes. Served with fresh locally made bread, grissini and flat bread.

The view from the Cellar Door is spectacular. The Narrow Neck escarpment looms up from the valley floor and in the afternoon the sandstone cliffs are transformed by beautiful bright orange and yellow colours as the sun drops lower over the Great Dividing Range to the west.
