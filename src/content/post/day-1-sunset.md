It was getting a bit late by the time we left Devil&#8217;s Corner, so we hurried to Coles Bay and arrived at the Visitor&#8217;s Centre just after 5pm to buy a 24 hour parking ticket. We then checked in to the Freycinet Lodge. This is the only accommodation facilities located inside the national park, and is currently undergoing construction work by it&#8217;s new owners Destinations RACT, but we were assured our lodge should not be affected. We enjoyed dinner at Richardson&#8217;s Bistro where I had a nice steak and enjoyed the lovely sunset which was really striking.
