The historic [Carrington Hotel](https://thecarrington.com.au/) (opened in 1883) hosts a set of Yulefest Gala Dinners over the winter months in July and August. These include

- Pre Dinner Drinks & Winter Canapes
- Traditional 5 Course Yulefest Dinner

In addition, we are entertained by carollers, pipe band, a Santa etc.

It was a fun night and festive occasion, and we really enjoyed ourselves.
