# YuleFest 2022

We celebrated Christmas in July at the Carrington Hotel, and then stayed for a couple of nights at Megalong Valley with some friends.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

In addition, each trip will be stored as a separate repository in the
`travelens` organization. This project integrates all the individual
repositories into a single seamless website.
